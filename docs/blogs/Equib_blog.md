# eQuib – Digitizing Traditional Savings Circles

## Overview

The goal of this project is to **digitize the traditional Equib (ROSCA)** savings model using a mobile app that promotes financial inclusion for individuals without access to formal banking systems. By integrating **mobile technology** with this cultural savings practice, the app will make participation more accessible, secure, and transparent, while maintaining the social trust and cooperative spirit that are at the heart of Equib.

## Key Features

1. **Secure Digital Payments and Contributions**

   - Users contribute their savings directly through **mobile money** (e.g., M-Pesa, Telebirr, or SMS-based payment systems).
   - Funds are held in a secure escrow system and disbursed to the designated recipient at the end of the contribution period.

2. **Customizable Rotations and Groups**

   - Participants can create private Equib groups with **custom rules** (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly contributions).
   - The app supports both **pre-set rotations** (where recipients are chosen beforehand) and **lottery-style selections** for payout order.

3. **Automated Notifications and Reminders**

   - Push notifications and SMS reminders help participants stay on track with contributions and notify them when it’s their turn to receive funds.

4. **Trust Mechanisms and Verification**

   - Users can **vouch for other members** (as in traditional Equibs) to ensure trust and accountability.
   - The app integrates **reputation scores** based on payment history to incentivize reliability and discourage defaults.

5. **Savings Progress and Reports**

   - Users can **track their savings** and group contributions, promoting transparency and financial planning.
   - A built-in **savings goal tracker** helps participants monitor personal financial goals.

6. **Community Forums and Support**
   - A **chat feature** allows members to communicate directly, fostering cooperation and trust.
   - The app also offers educational resources on **financial literacy** and best practices for managing personal finances.

## Impact

This app will empower **low-income and unbanked communities** by leveraging **cultural practices** and mobile technology, promoting **financial inclusion** and **community-based savings**. By digitizing the Equib tradition, it offers a **scalable solution** that blends the familiarity of local practices with the convenience of modern fintech tools.

This project idea ensures **cultural relevance**, promotes **financial cooperation**, and addresses the **real needs** of communities in developing countries. It is also scalable, providing opportunities for further expansion into other regions with similar ROSCA models, such as **Kenya (Chamas)** or **Nigeria (Esusu)**.
