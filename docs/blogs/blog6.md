## Prioritizing Stakeholders in Product Development: A Design That Matters

Building a company that prioritizes all stakeholders, not just shareholders, is essential yet challenging. As Lyle mentioned in class, this broader vision of success, rooted in ethical principles and societal well-being, requires deliberate design, strong leadership, and a focus on long-term impacts.

One of the key hurdles in product design is the delicate balance between rapid growth and ethical responsibility. The pressure to scale and drive revenue often leads to a short-term focus, which can sideline user health, happiness, and trust. As a new product designer, it's crucial to understand that predicting user behavior may take time, but it's a worthwhile investment in the long run.
While user behavior on open platforms can be unpredictable, software engineers and designers must take proactive measures throughout development. A user-centered approach, backed by comprehensive research and diverse testing, ensures that products are designed with all potential actions in mind. Engaging various user groups and conducting research can significantly enhance our design and product.

Ethical practices should be embedded into product design from the beginning. Following structured frameworks and toolkits and conducting internal ethics reviews can identify risks early. Rigorous testing and feedback loops, including prototyping edge cases and iterative assessments, help prevent harmful outcomes. Collaborative efforts with experts in social sciences and ethics, alongside independent audits, provide diverse perspectives and strengthen product integrity.

During a lecture Lyle said that **The Social Dilemma** is a good reminder that prioritizing user well-being from the start prevents costly, reactive responses and underscores the need for a shift from profit-first strategies. Leaders must advocate for long-term success by embedding transparency, empathy, and accountability into their culture. As future engineers, we are also responsible for gauging the company's value before we join them. Furthermore, we need to work towards creating a better future by getting involved in decision-making processes from our role as an intern to founding our own company that sets all stakeholders as benefactors of our end products. True progress is achieved when companies recognize that prioritizing all stakeholders, users, employees, partners, and society drives sustainable success. This balanced approach builds stronger communities, earns trust, and sets a new standard for the industry, proving that growth and ethics can coexist.
