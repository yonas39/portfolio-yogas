# Assignment 3

## Product Pitch: OrthoNet

OrthoNet is a dedicated platform explicitly designed for Orthodox Christians, including individuals, religious groups, preachers, priests, and spiritual leaders. It provides a space for deepening faith, sharing spiritual knowledge, and fostering a community around the Orthodox Christian belief system.
OrthoNet is a tailored experience focused on faith, prayer, and spiritual growth, unlike general social media platforms. Key features include a PrayerMate tool for connecting users in virtual prayer sessions, a Religious Event Calendar to notify users of local or global religious events and a Spiritual Reflection Tracker that encourages daily engagement and reflection on one’s spiritual journey. With real-time translation tools, live sermon streaming, and interactive Bible quizzes, OrthoNet offers an enriching environment for users of all ages and levels of spiritual involvement.
OrthoNet’s privacy-focused design ensures safe and respectful interactions, while its unique community-driven features, like the polling service, virtual pilgrimage tours, and note-taking during sermons, create a holistic experience for believers to connect with their faith and each other.
