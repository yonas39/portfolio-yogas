## Draft impact case

1. The **problem** of financial equality and access to loans is important because individuals, especially in underserved communities, face barriers in accessing traditional banking and loans. This is often due to a lack of credit history or cultural factors, leaving many reliant on trust-based models like ROSCA that, while beneficial, are limited in scope and accessibility.
2. Our **solution** to address this problem is Digital-ROSCA: a web application that digitizes the ROSCA model. It will offer secure digital payments, automate group cycles, build trust through user verification, and provide financial literacy resources.
3. We believe **Digital-ROSCA is a good solution** because it improves accessibility through the internet, supports financial inclusion without needing a credit history, ensures transparency and security, and enables scalability while maintaining cultural relevance.
4. We could **measure the impact** of Digital-ROSCA by tracking improvement in financial accessibility, introducing trust and reliability scores, monitoring loan success rates, and watching user growth/engagement across regions.

## External research findings

**ROSCA Advantages**

- **Financial Inclusion:** Provides access to financial resources for individuals who may not have access to formal banking systems, often benefiting low-income and immigrant communities by offering an alternative to traditional financial systems.
- **Community Trust and Social Capital:** Relies on the trust and social bonds within close-knit communities, which promotes accountability and encourages participants to fulfill their commitments.
- **Access to Lump-Sum Funds:** Enables members to access larger amounts of money periodically, which can be used for significant life events, small business ventures, or emergencies without interest payments, aligning with cultural or religious preferences, particularly in communities where interest is discouraged.

**Digital-ROSCA Advantages**

- **Increased Accessibility:** Digital platforms make ROSCAs more accessible to participants regardless of location, allowing people to participate remotely. A digital solution also has the potential to reach younger, more tech-savvy generations.
- **Efficient Management:** Automation of contributions and distributions streamlines operations, reducing the administrative burden and potential for error on organizers.

**Digital-ROSCA Disadvantages**

- **Loss of personal relationships:** One of key aspects of a traditional ROSCA is trust and social capital within close knit communities. A digitized system may weaken these relationships since personal interactions would be replaced with digital transactions.
- **Discourages formal practices:** With the lack of an important role played by formal financial institutions, digital-ROSCA may discourage credit building and good financial practices that these institutions encourage.
- **Financial and technical literacy:** In stakeholder countries technological literacy and access to tech is limited, there may be a steeper learning curve while transitioning from traditional to digital ROSCAs.
- **Risk of fraud and illegal activity:** With the lack of any formal governing entity, a digital solution introduces risk of unauthorized transactions by malicious actors, and online attacks that compromise the entire system.

## Interview summaries

Sarla Pareek has been a longtime participant of ROSCA groups in Udaipur, India for nearly 10 years. She spoke to the familial and supportive nature of gathering to contribute to the Chit fund, and catch up with loved ones. In Sarla’s experience, the winner of the Chit that month is determined by lottery, and the funds are often put towards weddings, rent, or community infrastructure. These gatherings, known as Kitty parties, offer Indian women an opportunity to reconnect and financially support one another in times of need. While digital-ROSCA presents an opportunity to close the physical gap between members, preserving the interpersonal connectedness of this experience will be important.

> "Long-term friendships and community ties provide a strong foundation of trust… Saying 'no' to a friend is difficult, but it's a potential concern."

Rediet, an experienced organizer of traditional ROSCAs (Equbs), shared a nuanced perspective on the processes, challenges, and social dynamics involved in managing communal savings groups. The interviewee emphasized that long-term friendships and community connections are vital to building trust among participants. While defaults are rare, social leverage provides a foundation for accountability. Rediet acknowledges, however, that legal backing and clear guidelines could add a needed layer of security. Finding ways to formalize trust without diminishing the community-based nature of ROSCAs could be a gamechanger.

> “The benefit is that people who no longer live in their community, or live far away, can send money through a GPay [Google Pay] to their ROSCA. So in a way, they can still continue to financially support the community. This is what digitization has brought.”

Deeply motivated by his family’s own experience, Professor Ashish Kumar Sedai researches the socioeconomic impacts of ROSCAs on developing nations. He shares that although digital ROSCAs present many new opportunities, his research has validated the importance of preserving the social bonds, trust, and cultural relevance that lie at the heart of ROSCAs. These systems have become tools for financial inclusion and women's empowerment in countries like India. The key lies in using technology to strengthen, not replace, the human connections and community support that have made these groups successful, particularly in traditional societies.

> “Haitians can’t save for shit. Most people don’t own a bank account, this is basically their savings…It may not necessarily translate directly into social mobility or profit, but it will allow them to keep making money and put food on the table.”

Wilhem Hector is a current senior in the MIT class of 2025, born and raised in Haiti. Having come from humble beginnings in a country riddled with poverty and gang violence, Hector is quite familiar with ROSCA, also known as Sol in his country. His own parents are frequent beneficiaries of the model, often joining circles to replenish their own trades or put food on the table. In his experience, all financial dealings of a ROSCA are handled physically, with no technology whatsoever. While he acknowledges the cultural significance of Sol to most Haitians, Hector would never join a circle himself due to concerns over trustworthiness and reliability.

## Value-sensitive design

ROSCA systems are typically practiced in low-income, developing nations that already have limited access to smartphones, digital technology, and banking institutions. Thus, the necessity of online bank accounts and smartphones could potentially exclude a segment of these stakeholders from participation in a digital ROSCA. Such groups are far less likely to switch from existing solutions, leaving us to target developing nations with some access to tech.

There is a huge social component to traditional ROSCA systems. Circles are typically formed between community members, and trusted members of the neighborhood are usually the organizers. Digitizing this system could undermine the community-building aspect that comes with in-person ROSCA circles, which is quite central to the cultures that practice them. However, many members of traditional savings circles are accustomed to collecting their funds immediately, sometimes to expense time-sensitive, short-term events. Introducing bank transfers and wait times could potentially encourage more planned spending and financial growth.

Over time, the digitization of ROSCA systems could prompt user concerns around security, privacy, and trustworthiness. Not only are digital systems at greater risk of attack or technical failure, but they are more likely to fall victim to government regulation. This could further skepticism by stakeholders that already distrust formal institutions and corruption in government. Furthermore, online platforms simply can’t offer the same levels of trust and familiarity as community members.

Due to ROSCA’s pervasiveness in developing countries, other nations with formal banking institutions and greater financial literacy may have less of a use case for the platform. Thus, our app may struggle to gain traction in countries where individual savings accounts are common and preferred.

Nefarious actors could game the platform by joining circles, contributing until it’s their turn to receive the pot, then going inactive. This could ruin other users’ experience of the platform, and hurt them financially. We’d probably want some safeguards in place that bar noncontributors from joining future rotations, and prevent users from quitting early.

## Revised impact case

1. **The Problem: Financial Equality and Access to Loans**
   Financial equality and access to loans are critical issues that impact many individuals, especially those in underserved communities with limited access to traditional banking. Furthermore, traditional banking institutions often exclude individuals who lack significant credit history, or possess opposing cultural and religious beliefs. In many parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the Rotational Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) model has long provided these groups an alternative way to build savings and credit through communal effort. However, current implementations are still quite primal, completely reliant on trust and interpersonal relationships to function effectively. These approaches are often limited in scale, accessibility, and efficiency.

2. **The Solution: Digital-ROSCA**
   Our team proposes a solution to digitize ROSCA through a web application that maintains the essence of community-driven savings, while leveraging modern technology for broader reach and operational ease. Our platform will: enable secure digital payments and contributions to the savings pot; automate cycle rotations and group management; build trust through user verification and reliability evaluations; and offer educational resources supporting financial literacy.

3. **Why Digital-ROSCA is an Effective Solution**
   Digital-ROSCA addresses key limitations of the traditional model:

   - **Accessibility:** Internet technology opens participation to more people, including those in remote or rural areas.
   - **Financial Inclusion:** The system supports those with limited or no access to traditional loans due to a lack of credit history.
   - **Transparency and Security:** The platform’s secure payment systems and detailed transaction records mitigate risks associated with manual handling.
   - **Scalability:** Digital-ROSCA can reach a larger pool of participants, expanding the impact beyond localized communities.
   - **Cultural Relevance:** Digitizing a familiar model ensures that target communities accept and adopt the solution more easily.

4. **Measuring Impact**
   To prove Digital-ROSCA’s efficacy in promoting financial equality and loan access, we will measure:
   - **Financial Accessibility Metrics:** Track the number of participants who gain access to a savings and loan structure without needing formal banking.
   - **User Trust and Reliability Scores:** Analyze data on how reputation systems influence group participation and trust.
   - **Loan Provision Success Rates:** Evaluate the frequency and timeliness of payouts and early withdrawal requests.
   - **Adoption and Participation:** Monitor user growth, engagement levels, and geographic reach over time.
