- **Intended Audience:**Â "OrthoNet" is a religious app designed for Orthodox Christian believers, including individuals, groups, preachers, priests, and spiritual leaders. It is a dedicated space for sharing, discussing, and deepening religious and spiritual beliefs within the Orthodox Christian community.

- **Value:** This application provides a unique platform that focuses on building a community centered around faith and sprituality, offering tools for communal prayers, live discussions, and knowlege sharing. Unlike general social media platforms, it is dedicated to creating a respectful and enriching environment for users to explore and deepen their religious beliefs while connecting with other who share their spiritual journey.
